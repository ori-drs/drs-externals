atlas_robot_command_t,duplicated but will be depreciated,,,
force_torque_t,duplicated but will be depreciated,,,
raw imu and batch,"duplicated but will be depreciated, renamed to be kvh_****",,,signal scope
,,,,
,,,,
state sync,put this within the atlas driver,,,
signal scope,just remove these types,,,
Fall detector used high level bdi behaviour bit,make this a separate message published as ROBOT_BEHAVIOR,,,
a very small number of places in director,load the atlasdriver.py only for Atlas,,,
bdi and ihmc translators,the former should be packaged with the atlas driver. The later can be written more simply,,,

"In July 2015 I rationalised the unused lcmtypes and removed 122, leaving 117 types. A summary is below",,,,
Maurice,,,,
,,,,
Future plans:,,,,
Move all Atlas types into the Atlas driver,Working on it,,,
Make the control loop function without any Atlas-specific message e.g. with a ROBOT_COMMAND ,Agreed,,,
message and using drc_joint_states and force torque instead of atlas_joint_states,DONE,,,
ﾅ so that the proprietory driver can be optional,,,,
Group the LCM types into distinct message pods/packages (as below) as in ROS,,,,
This requires more study of connectivity. It's likely that some types are heavily used,,,,
Make maps an independent project?,,,,
